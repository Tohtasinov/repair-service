              When your appliance breaks, it is the job of our appliance
              technician to diagnose the problem. If your fridge is not cold,
              your dryer is not spinning or your oven wonâ€™t turn on, the first
              step is for our appliance technician to visit your home and
              inspect the appliance. This is called a service call and will
              result in a diagnosis of your appliance problem and an estimate of
              the repair cost. The service call can take a few minutes or will
              require to dissemble the appliance and can take longer. The fee is
              $75 for a service call evaluation within an hour timeframe. Many
              repairs can be diagnosed within one hour. If the diagnosis takes
              more than one hour, the service call fee will increase.

              Once the appliance technician completes the diagnosis, they will
              explain the problem to you and the estimated cost and estimated
              timeframe that it would take to repair your appliance. If you
              decide not to proceed with the repair, you will pay the technician
              the service charge fee for coming to your home and diagnosing your
              appliance problem. If you would like to proceed with the repair
              and have your appliance fixed by the technician, the cost will
              include: the hourly cost of labor plus the cost of part(s). The
              good news is that if your repair does not require ordering a
              custom part and would not require the technician coming to your
              home a second time, we can apply the $75 service call fee toward
              the total cost of your same day repair. This would occur in cases
              where we have the required repair part in our van. In such cases,
              you will pay for labor plus parts. However, the $75 service charge
              fee will be applied toward the total repair amount. In cases where
              the repair is more complex and time consuming, requiring the
              ordering of specific parts (using the model and serial number of
              your appliance) and requiring a second visit to your home, you
              will be required to pay the service call fee along with the cost
              of parts and labor of the repair. Our hourly labor fee is $75.
              Rest assured that there are absolutely no hidden fees. We aim to
              be as transparent as possible about pricing. The technician will
              provide you a total estimate so you can make an informed decision
              about the repair. We will not proceed with any repairs without
              customer approval and knowledge about pricing! To make it easier
              for our customers, we accept Check, Cash, Zelle and Venmo! **

                  We do not pro-rate the hourly labor charge. Whether the
                  technician takes 15 mins or 55 mins to repair your appliance,
                  the hourly labor rate of $75+ tax applies.
